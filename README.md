# Project 1
# COVID-19 and It's Impact on Minnesota

## Team:
###   Sung Ahn, Lief Herzfeld, Tom Lenzmeier, Mauvonte Roberts, and Mai Yang

### Our project focused on the impact of COVID-19 on racial groups in MN as well as those in poverty.
### We asked: Does COVID more adversely affect non-caucasians? Similarly, does COVID more adversely affect people in poverty as compared to those who are not in poverty?

## Steps:
### 1. Using API calls, retrieve the data from the CDC & the US Census Bureau
### 2. Reduce the data to a manageable level; a level that Git likes!
### 3. Create a random sample from the CDC data.
### 4. Clean the data -- clean data is happy data.
### 5. Organize the data; including groupby, sum, and other steps.
### 6. Merge the two datasets.
### 7. Compile a statistical summary of the data.
### 8. Render charts and boxplots of the statistical data.
### 9. Formulate our null hypothesises.
### 10. Perform hypothesis tests.
### 11. Draw conclusions based on our tests.
### 12. Present our findings.
### 13. It's Miller time!
